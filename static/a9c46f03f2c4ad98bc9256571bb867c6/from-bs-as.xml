      <lb/>The Soil is as good and Fertile here as

      <lb/><reg>some</reg> parts of the Road are uninhabited 
      <lb/>for a long way together; I <reg>furnished</reg>

      <lb/>Mules, <reg>some</reg> to carry my Baggage, and 
      <lb/>the <reg>rest</reg> to change upon the way when 
      <lb/>that I rid upon was tired.</p> 
<p>
<lb/>From <name type="place">Buenos Ayres</name>, to the <name type="placeGeog">River Lu-

<lb/><measure>30 Leagues</measure>, I <choice><sic>pass’d</sic><corr>passed</corr></choice> by several Habita
<lb/>tions and Farms cultivated by the Spani

<lb/>as all the <reg>rest</reg> in the Provinces of <name type="place">Buenos

<p><lb/>any other accident <reg>swells</reg> them, a Tra-

<lb/>which a <rs type="native_group" subtype="colonial_denomination">Savage</rs> hawls over to the other

<lb/><choice><sic>forc'd</sic><corr>forced</corr></choice> to make <reg>use</reg> of this expedient

<lb/>a great bundle with thongs of the <reg>same</reg> 
<lb/>Hide, upon which I <choice><sic>plac'd</sic><corr>placed</corr></choice> my <reg>self</reg> with

<lb/>and then he <reg><choice><sic>repass'd</sic><corr>repassed</corr></choice></reg> and <reg>swam</reg> my <reg>Horses</reg> 
<lb/>and Mules over to me.
<lb/>All the Country between the <name type="placeGeog">River

<lb/>abounds in Cattle and all <reg>sorts</reg> of Fruit 
<lb/>trees, except Walnut and Chesnut-trees; 
<lb/>there are whole Woods of Nectarine-
<lb/>Trees, <measure>Three or Four Leagues</measure> in <reg>compass</reg>, 
<lb/>that bear excellent Fruit, which they 
<lb/>not only eat raw, but bake them, or dry 
<lb/>them in the Sun, to keep, as we in <name type="country">France</name> 
<lb/>do Prunes: They <reg>seldom</reg> <reg>use</reg> any other 
<lb/>than the Wood of this Tree for common 
<lb/>firing at <name type="place">Buenos Ayres</name>, and thereabouts. 
<lb/>The <rs type="native_group" subtype="colonial_denomination">Savages</rs> that dwell in <reg>these</reg> Parts are

<div><p><lb/>voluntarily ſubmit to the Spaniards are <lb/>call’d Panpiſtas, the reſt Serranos, both <lb/>cloathed with Skins, but the laſt ſet up <lb/>on the Panpiſtas as their mortal Enemies <lb/>wherever they meet with them. All <lb/>Fight on Horſe-back, either with Lances <lb/>pointed with Iron or Bones ſharpen'd, <lb/>or else with Bows and Arrows, they <lb/>wear Bulls-hides faſhion'd like a Doublet <lb/>without ſleeves, to defend their Bodies. <lb/>Their Chiefs that command over them <lb/>in War and Peace, are call’d Couracas. <lb/>When they take any one of their Ene<lb/>mies, alive or dead, they meet all toge<lb/>ther, and after they have reproach'd him, <lb/>that either he or his Relations were the <lb/>death of their Kindred or Friends, they <lb/>cut and tear him into pieces, which they <lb/>roaſt a little and eat, making a drinking <lb/>Bowl of his Scull. They feed moſtly <lb/>upon flesh either raw or dreſs'd, and <lb/>particularly Colts fleſh, which they like! <lb/>better than Veal. They catch abundance <lb/>of Fiſh likewiſe in their Rivers, They <lb/>have no ſettled places of aboad, but <lb/>ramble up and down, ſeveral Families <lb/>together, and live in Tents. 
<lb/>I could not inform my ſelf exactly <lb/>what Religion they were of, but I was <lb/>told that they look'd upon the Sun and <lb/>Moon</p>
</div>
<div><p>Moon as Deities and as I travell'd along, I ſaw a Savage upon his knees with his Face to the Sun, who cry'd out and made ſtrange geſtures with his Hands and Arms. I learn'd from the Savage that accompany'd me, that he was one of thoſe they call'd Papas, who in the Morning kneel towards the Sun, and at Night towards the Moon, to ſupplicate those fancy'd Divinities to be propitious to them, to give them fair Weather, and Victory over their Foes. 
They make no great Ceremony in their Marriages ; but when a Relation dies, after they have rubb’d his body with a certain Earth that conſumes all but the Bones, they preserve them, and carry as many of them as they can conveniently about with them in a ſort of Cheſts, and this they do in token of their affection to their Kindred ; indeed they are not wanting in good Offices to them during their Lives, nor in their Sickneſs and Death. 
Along the River Salladillo, I took notice of a great many Parrats, or Papagays, as the Spaniards call them, and certain Birds, call’d Guacamayos, which are of divers Colours, and twice or thrice as big as a Parrat. The River it ſelf is full
